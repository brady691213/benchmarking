# Benchmarking.Linq

A little research project to use [BenchmarkDotNet](https://benchmarkdotnet.org/articles/overview.html) on basic LINQ queries using very large Parquet datasets.

## Todo List

Checkout .NET language projection libraries:

- Language Ext - This library allows defining data types based on a schema at runtime without pre-generated classes using LINQ projections.
- Siros - Provides dynamic and typed projection of data sources like Parquet into .NET objects.
- Misc.Extensions - A lightweight library with dynamic schema projection capabilities.
